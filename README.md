# CalculateOhmValue
Calculates resistor values for 4 band resistors and is easily extendable to 5-6 band resistors without too many changes.


## Installing / Getting started

This solution was designed using Visual Studio 2017 using the 4.71 .NET Framework.  It should also work with Visual Studio 2015.



## Developing

In order to get started with development, bring the code down to your local instance.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/figentropy/CalculateOhmValue.git

cd CalculateOhmValue

Using Visual Studio, open the solution OhmCalculator.sln
```


### Building

The solution is comprised of 6 projects located in seperate solution folders.
